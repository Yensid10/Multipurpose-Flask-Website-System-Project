        <div class="panel">
            <p>You can click through the menu and see descriptions of items.
                Although customers can edit out items specific to their own dietary
                restrictions, it is still good to learn the menu and help give 
                recommendations based on their needs. You could also speak to the 
                kitchen staff to learn specifics about menu items, such as how they are 
                made, any possible contaminants, etc.,.

        <button class="accordion">Engaging with customers</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Customers are at the fore-front of our business- our success is measured
                almost entirely by how they feel at the beginning, middle, and end of their meal.
                Due to this, it is very imporant that the first impression you make is one that is 
                inviting and friendly. Don't view patrons as customers, but rather friends you
                would enjoy having a conversation with outside of work. More often than not, most
                customers will be more than happy to talk and respond to you with the same respect and friendliness
                you show them. However, there will always be bad apples every so often. It is important
                to still maintain a level of respect and tolerance with these types of customers, and to never bring yourself
                to their level, instead maintaining the level of service and friendliness Oaxaca is known for.

        <button class="accordion">Checking up on customers</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Checking up on customers is a very important part of service that can not be
                ignored. This gives an opportunity to find out any grievances a patron had with their
                meal and how you can remedy it. This allows us to maintain a higher level of customer 
                service by ensuring we do our best to make sure customers leave happy. You can also use
                this moment to offer drink refills, extra utensils and napkins, or anything else the customer 
                needs.

        <div class="panel">
            <p>If there is an issue which you cant resolve through this page, there are multiple 
                routes you can take:
                <br>
                <br>If it is a relatively small issue, such as a customer asking to edit an order
                after it has already been published and accepted, try talking to a fellow colleague, and 
                getting their feedback and help on the issue.
                <br>
                <br>If this still doesn't resolve the issue, or if the issue is too big, speak to your 
                line/ shift manager to get their help in resolving the issue.
                <br>
                <br>These situations can also be very important learning opportunities for you to learn
                how to manage and respond to different situations which you may not be used to.
